# all_files_renaming
This project is a python application, for the line command in terminal. It runs a countdown (set by the user) for break time at work or study. The "all_files_renaming.py" is a project sample, which I am making as a demonstration of some of my abilities. It is found also on my portfolio: https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio .
