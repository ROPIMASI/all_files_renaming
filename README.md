# all_files_renaming  

### This project is a python application, for the line command in terminal. It runs a countdown (set by the user) for break time at work or study.  

### The "all_files_renaming.py" is a project sample, which I am making as a demonstration of some of my abilities. It is also found on my portfolio: https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio .
