# all_files_renaming  

### This project is a python application, for the command line in terminal. It renames all files in a directory/folder at the same time, or, if the user prefers, the program runs an assistant to rename all files in a directory/folder.  

### The **_"all_files_renaming.py"_** is a project sample, which I am making as a demonstration of some of my abilities. It is also found on my portfolio: https://ropimasi.wixsite.com/portfolio .
